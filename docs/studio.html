            Or Excel file which contains all the listings/records which will be
            served by the directory.
        </p>
        <h3 id="collections">Collections</h3>
        <p>
            Or worksheets in excel file, are collection of records. E.g. if the
            directory is about &quot;Job Listings&quot; then the collection
            would &quot;jobs&quot;. It is expected that minimum 2 collections
            are present.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong> _collections</strong>: This is &quot;reserved&quot;
                worksheet/collection which contains metadata for the directory.
                Every directory can host multiple collections. E.g. For Job
                Listings directory, there can be &quot;jobs&quot; and
                &quot;companies&quot; as different collections. This worksheet
                named as &quot;_collections&quot; contains all the collections
                served by the directory.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Required columns: a. <code>id</code>: Number. Unique serial ID for
            every row in the worksheet b. <code>collection</code>: Text. Unique,
            name of other worksheets which are collections served by the
            directory
        </p>
        <p>
            Optional columns: a. <code>slug</code>: Text. Unique, URL slug for
            this collection. For &quot;job&quot; collection if the slug is
            &quot;jobs&quot; then all the records/listings under this collection
            would have URL <code>domain/jobs/{job-id}</code>. If not provided
            then a slug is autogenerated based on worksheet name.
        </p>
        <p>You can other columns too.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Your collections: This is the actual collections which are
                served by the directory e.g. &quot;jobs&quot; or
                &quot;companies&quot;. Each collection has its own worksheet
                with unique name (no special characters except underscore). Name
                of this worksheet is added under <code>collection</code> column
                in <code>_collections</code> worksheet, effectively registering
                this collection.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Required columns: a. <code>id</code>: Number. Unique serial ID for
            every row in the worksheet b. <code>title</code>: Text. Unqiue,
            title of every record/listing in this collection
        </p>
        <p>
            Optional columns: a. <code>slug</code>: Text. Unique, URL slug for
            this record/listing. For a particular job under jobs collection, if
            the slug is &quot;job-123&quot;, then the URL for that webpage would
            be <code>domain/jobs/job-123</code>. No special characters except
            hyphens.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can have other columns like image, URLs, description. Upto you.

        <h2 id="importing-data">Importing data</h2>
        <p>
            Before you begin you need to import all data (listings). This data
            affects pages created and dynamic data that can be populated.
        </p>
        <p>
            For every new project, importing data is required step you cannot
            proceed to designing without it. For subsequent design or to update
            data in future, go over to data tab and import again, check this
            video for demo.
        </p>
        <p>
            This video demonstrates, initial import when project is newly
            created. The imported excel only cantains one worksheet
            &quot;pages&quot; (slug &quot;/pages2&quot;). Later new worksheet is
            imported with 2 worksheets &quot;pages&quot; (slug
            &quot;/pages&quot;) &amp; &quot;search_engines&quot; (slug
            &quot;/se&quot;) from the Data tab.

        </video>

        <p>
            After importing, the Data tab shows available variables for the
            imported collection.
        </p>
        <h2 id="how-to-design">How to design</h2>
        <p>
            To begin, start by opening the elements pane from right side and
            drag any element on to the canvas.

        <p>
            <strong>Demo 2:</strong> Adding an IMG (image) element Certain
            elments require additional data to be displayed. E.g. Image or Link
            which require to you add src attributes.

            Element types: static vs dynamic
        </h2>
        <p>Content can be either of</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Static: Always constant no matter what, imagine static text on
                webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dynamic: Depends on webpage&#39;s slug, imagine text or an image
                which changes based on each record&#39;s page.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="adding-static-elements">Adding static elements</h3>
        <p>
            Its rather easy just drag and drop any element on to canvas. Its
            static by default.
        </p>
        <h3 id="adding-dynamic-elements">Adding dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>
            Drag any element onto canvas. Depending on element type you&#39;ll
            have to add dynamic content.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For text types</strong>, edit the text and add text in
            following format
            <code>{{ record &quot;&lt;column name&gt;&quot; }}</code>. Here
            <code>&lt;column name&gt;</code> is column name from the
            spreadhseet. Or better yet, just copy the column from Data tab.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>For image or link</strong>, Images and link require extra
            information to work. This fields are available under Styles tab.
            Process is still the same, add
            <code>{{ record &quot;&lt;column name&gt; }}</code> or copy column
            from Data tab.

title: New Directory
---

Starting a new directory? You need 3 things:

1. __title__: An internal only directory title to identify it amongst other directories on your dashboard.
  Title should be a single word, alphabets only (no numbers or special characters) and unique amongst other directories on your dashboard.
2. __domain__: An URL where you'll host the directory. Once the directory is published, DNS records will be shared
  which customers are expected to add them to thier domain provider so that the directory can be served on that domain/URL.
3. __data__: An excel (".xlsx") file which contains all the collections & listings. There are certain structure which is expected from
  this excel file. This is explained in the [next section](/docs/data).

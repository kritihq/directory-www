We're excited to announce a significant upgrade to how our platform handles sitemaps, making your content even more discoverable by search engines!

Previously, managing sitemaps could be a manual process. Now, we've implemented **automatic sitemap generation** for every URL on your site, including all collections and individual records within them. This means less work for you and better visibility for your content.

Here's a quick overview of what's new:

* **Intelligent Sitemap Structure:** A central `sitemap.xml` file at your site's root acts as a sitemap index, pointing to dynamically generated sitemaps for each of your collections.

* **Optimized for Performance:** Each sitemap file is limited to a maximum of 50,000 URLs, adhering to sitemap protocol specifications for efficient crawling.

* **Future-Ready:** While a default URL template is currently in use, our next sitemap release will give you the power to customize this template, enabling support for advanced features like image and video sitemap extensions. Part 2, <sup>comming soon</sup>

This update lays the groundwork for even more robust SEO capabilities, ensuring your content is easily found by the right audience. Stay tuned for more enhancements!

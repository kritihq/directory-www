We're thrilled to announce the next evolution in our sitemap features, putting powerful SEO tools directly at your fingertips. Building on our recent automatic sitemap generation, you can now fine-tune how search engines crawl and index your content, page by page!

<br/>

* **Page-Specific Sitemap Control:**
  You'll find a brand new section in **Kriti Studio** that allows you to customize sitemap settings for individual pages (records within collections). This means you can specify how important a page is, how often it changes, and when it was last updated.

* **Rich Media Sitemaps (Image & Video):**
  Boost your multimedia content's visibility! We've integrated **Google's sitemap extensions for images and videos**. Now, you can tell search engines about the images and videos on your pages, helping them appear in relevant search results.

* **Cleaner, More Accurate Sitemaps:**
  We've made significant improvements behind the scenes. This update ensures that your sitemaps are perfectly formatted, include only the necessary information, and accurately reflect your page's content, resolving previous issues with permalinks and image data.

These enhancements give you unprecedented control over your site's search engine presence, making it easier for your audience to find your valuable content. Get ready to supercharge your SEO!
